# college-bus-booking-system
The College Bus Booking System is a Java-based desktop application designed to manage college transportation efficiently.
The system allows authorized users to book buses, generate unique PNR and Reference ID, and cancel bookings easily.
It uses MySQL as the backend database to store and retrieve booking details securely. 
This system reduces manual work, improves accuracy, and provides an organized approach to bus management.
